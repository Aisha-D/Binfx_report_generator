# Binfx_report_generator

Set a scheduler to run on the first of every month to:
- generate plots (helpdesk):
    - Workload trend
    - Opened vs closed tickets this month
    - Trends of raised tickets
    - Tickets by status
    - First response time (% over time, how many tickets meet first reponse SLA out of all tickets in that month)
    - Resolution time (similiar to response)

- Produce reports

- To include number of data processed (?)
